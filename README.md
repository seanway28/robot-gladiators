# robot-gladiators

The game must be created by a single developer in 24 hours. The game must run in a web browser. The game must use the provided index.html file. Only the <title> element of index.html may be changed. Participants cannot use CSS. All game code must be contained in the game.js JavaScript file. Extra points for code quality! After some reflection, we've decided to build an action-packed robot combat simulator game called Robot Gladiators. During the game, the player will coach their robot through a series of fights, gaining cash, attack power, and repairs along the way. The robot who survives with the most cash will be remembered in the browser's storage system! While we begin the build of the game we will be covering the following JavaScript fundamentals as a part of this lesson's objectives:

Use of functions to communicate with the user. Use variables and operators to assign and manipulate data. Manage conditional statements to control the flow of the application.

When we're done, the game will play like this:

The game will prompt the user to name their robot.

The player's robot will be initialized with the following properties:

100 health points 10 attack points 10 money points

The player's opponent, Roborto, will be initialized with the following properties:

50 health points 12 attack points

The game will display "Welcome to Robot Gladiators!"

The game will prompt the user to either fight the round or skip it.

If the player chooses to skip:

A penalty of 10 money points will be deducted from the player's robot.

The game will end.

If the player chooses to fight:

The player's robot will attack Roborto, and the player robot's attack points will be deducted from Roborto's health points.

The game will display Roborto's remaining health points.

Roborto will attack the player's robot, and Roberto's attack points will be deducted from the player's robot's health points.

The game will display the player robot's remaining health points.

The game will end.
